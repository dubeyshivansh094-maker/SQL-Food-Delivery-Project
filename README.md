# SQL-Food-Delivery-Project

SQL Data Analysis Project: FoodieFiesta Delivery Service
This repository contains a SQL project that simulates a database for a fictional food delivery service named "FoodieFiesta". The project demonstrates skills in database design, data manipulation, and analytical querying to derive business insights.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a relational database from the ground up, populate it with sample data, and then perform analytical queries to answer common business questions. This showcases a practical application of SQL in a business intelligence context.

Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated:
Data Definition Language (DDL): CREATE SCHEMA, CREATE TABLE, defining data types, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY constraints, ENUM, and CHECK constraints.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): INSERT INTO to populate tables with logical data, UPDATE to modify records.

Data Query Language (DQL):

SELECT statements with JOIN (INNER JOIN).

Aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG().

GROUP BY and ORDER BY for data aggregation and sorting.

WHERE clauses for filtering.

LIMIT to find top-N results.

Project Structure
The project is organized into three separate, numbered SQL scripts for clarity and modularity:

1_schema_creation.sql: This script contains all the DDL statements to create the database schema and define the structure of all tables and their relationships.

2_data_insertion.sql: This script contains all the DML INSERT statements needed to populate the tables with realistic sample data, including customers, restaurants, orders, etc.

3_analytical_queries.sql: This is the analysis part of the project. It contains several queries, each designed to answer a specific business question. Each query is commented to explain its purpose.

How to Run This Project
To run this project, you will need a SQL database system (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server).

Create the Schema: Execute the entire 1_schema_creation.sql script in your SQL client. This will create all the necessary tables.

Insert the Data: Execute the entire 2_data_insertion.sql script. This will populate the tables with the sample data.

Run the Analysis: Execute the queries in the 3_analytical_queries.sql script one by one to see the results and insights from the data.

Sample Business Questions Answered
This project's analytical queries provide answers to questions such as:

What is the total revenue generated by each restaurant?

Who are our most active customers?

What is the most popular food item on the platform?

Which restaurants have the best average order ratings?
